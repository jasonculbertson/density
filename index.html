        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays the same"],
        correctAnswer: "Decreases",
        explanation: "When popcorn pops, some water inside turns to steam and escapes. This makes the popcorn a tiny bit lighter."
    },
    {
        "question": "If you cut a metal bar in half, what happens to the density of each piece?",
        "type": "multipleChoice",
        "options": ["It increases", "It decreases", "It stays the same"],
        "correctAnswer": "It stays the same",
        "explanation": "Cutting the bar in half doesn’t change its density. Each piece has the same density as the original bar."
    },
    {
        "question": "A piece of ice has a volume of 10 cm³ and a mass of 9 grams. What is its density?",
        "type": "calculation",
        "correctAnswer": 0.9,
        "unit": "g/cm³",
        "explanation": "Density is calculated by dividing mass by volume. Here, 9 g ÷ 10 cm³ = 0.9 g/cm³."
    },
    {
        "question": "If you have two objects of the same mass, one small and one large, which one has a higher density?",
        "type": "multipleChoice",
        "options": ["Smaller object", "Larger object", "They have the same density"],
        "correctAnswer": "Smaller object",
        "explanation": "A smaller object with the same mass as a larger object is more compact, so it has a higher density."
    },
    {
        question: "Which has more density: a rock or a marshmallow of the same size?",
        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Rock", "Marshmallow", "They have the same density"],
        correctAnswer: "Rock",
        explanation: "A rock is much heavier than a marshmallow of the same size, so it has a higher density."
    },

        "question": "If you have a piece of clay and mold it into a different shape, what happens to its density?",
        "type": "multipleChoice",
        "options": ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays the same"],
        "correctAnswer": "Stays the same",

        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Feathers", "Books", "They would weigh the same"],
        correctAnswer: "Books",
        explanation: "Books are denser than feathers, so a box of books would be much heavier than a box of feathers of the same size."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens to an object's density if you squish it into a smaller space without changing its mass?",
        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays the same"],
        correctAnswer: "Increases",
        explanation: "When you squish something into a smaller space, its density increases because you're fitting the same amount of stuff into less space."
    },

    "question": "What happens to the density of a gas when you compress it into a smaller space?",
    "type": "multipleChoice",
    "options": ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays the same"],
    "correctAnswer": "Increases",
    "explanation": "Compressing a gas into a smaller space increases its density because the same amount of gas now occupies less volume."
    },

        question: "What happens to the volume of a balloon when you blow it up?",
        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays the same"],
        correctAnswer: "Increases",
        explanation: "When you blow up a balloon, you're adding air to it, which makes it bigger. This means its volume increases."

        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Sand", "Water", "They will mix evenly"],
        correctAnswer: "Sand",
        explanation: "Sand is denser than water, so it will sink to the bottom of the jar."
    },
    {
        question: "A block of wood has a mass of 100 grams and a volume of 200 cubic centimeters. What is its density?",
        type: "calculation",
        correctAnswer: 0.5,
        unit: "g/cm³",
        explanation: "To find density, divide mass by volume. Here, 100g ÷ 200cm³ = 0.5g/cm³."
    },
    {
        question: "If a liquid has a density of 1.5 g/mL and you have 100 mL of it, what is its mass?",
        type: "calculation",
        correctAnswer: 150,
        unit: "g",

    {
        question: "Which of these is NOT a unit used to measure volume?",
        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Liter", "Gallon", "Cubic meter", "Kilogram"],
        correctAnswer: "Kilogram",
        explanation: "Kilogram is a unit of mass, not volume. The other options are all used to measure volume."
    },
    {
        question: "If you have a full water bottle and drink half of it, what happens to the mass?",
        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays the same"],
        correctAnswer: "Decreases",
        explanation: "When you drink half the water, you're removing mass from the bottle. Less water means less mass overall."
    },
    {
        question: "A container holds 500 mL of juice. If you pour out 150 mL, how much is left?",
        type: "calculation",
        correctAnswer: 350,
        unit: "mL",
        explanation: "To find what's left, subtract what was poured out from the total. 500 mL - 150 mL = 350 mL."
    },
    {
        question: "If a block of clay has a mass of 50 grams, and you split it exactly in half, what will be the mass of each piece?",
        type: "calculation",
        correctAnswer: 25,
        unit: "g",
        explanation: "When you split the clay in half, each piece will have half the original mass. 50 g ÷ 2 = 25 g for each piece."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens to the volume of a sponge when you squeeze it?",
        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays the same"],
        correctAnswer: "Decreases",
        explanation: "When you squeeze a sponge, you're compressing it, which reduces its size. This means its volume decreases."
    },
    {
        question: "A recipe calls for 250 mL of milk. If your measuring cup only shows cups, and 1 cup is 240 mL, how many cups of milk do you need?",
        type: "calculation",
        correctAnswer: 1.04,
        unit: "cups",
        explanation: "To convert mL to cups, divide 250 mL by 240 mL/cup. 250 ÷ 240 ≈ 1.04 cups."
    },
    {
        question: "If you stack three identical boxes, how does the total height change compared to one box?",
        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["It triples", "It doubles", "It increases by half"],
        correctAnswer: "It triples",
        explanation: "Stacking three identical boxes will make the total height three times as tall as one box."
    },
    {
        question: "A small box measures 10 cm long, 5 cm wide, and 2 cm tall. What is its volume?",
        type: "calculation",
        correctAnswer: 100,
        unit: "cm³",
        explanation: "To find the volume of a box, multiply length × width × height. Here, 10 cm × 5 cm × 2 cm = 100 cm³."

        question: "A cube of sugar weighs 4 grams and has a volume of 2.5 cm³. What is its density?",
        type: "calculation",
        correctAnswer: 1.6,
        unit: "g/cm³",
        explanation: "Density is calculated by dividing mass by volume. Here, 4 g ÷ 2.5 cm³ = 1.6 g/cm³."

    {
        question: "What happens to the density of a sponge when you squeeze it?",
        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays the same"],
        correctAnswer: "Increases",
        explanation: "When you squeeze a sponge, you're reducing its volume without changing its mass, which increases its density."
    },
    {
        question: "If an object has a mass of 30 grams and a volume of 10 cm³, what is its density?",
        type: "calculation",
        correctAnswer: 3,
        unit: "g/cm³",
        explanation: "Density is calculated by dividing mass by volume. Here, 30 g ÷ 10 cm³ = 3 g/cm³."

        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Pebble", "Bowling ball", "They would sink at the same rate"],
        correctAnswer: "Bowling ball",
        explanation: "While both are denser than water and will sink, the bowling ball has more mass and will experience a stronger gravitational pull, causing it to sink faster."
    },
    {
        question: "If you have a full water bottle and drink half of it, what happens to its density?",
        type: "multipleChoice",
        options: ["Increases", "Decreases", "Stays the same"],
        correctAnswer: "Stays the same",
        explanation: "The density of the water doesn't change when you drink half of it. You're removing both mass and volume proportionally, so the density remains the same."
    },
    {
        question: "A rectangular prism measures 5 cm long, 3 cm wide, and 2 cm tall. What is its volume?",
        type: "calculation",
        correctAnswer: 30,
        unit: "cm³",
        explanation: "The volume of a rectangular prism is length × width × height. So, 5 cm × 3 cm × 2 cm = 30 cm³."
